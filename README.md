## 🚀 Overview

**Biwenger Stats** is a full-stack companion app for fantasy basketball managers competing in Biwenger's Euroleague format. It syncs live data from the Biwenger private API and the official Euroleague API through a custom ETL pipeline, storing it in PostgreSQL for deep analytical querying.

The platform provides insights unavailable in the native Biwenger app — from identifying undervalued market opportunities ("Sniper Mode") to tracking exact profit margins on every trade, calculating ideal lineups, and visualising squad growth over a season.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for the local database)

   4. Prompt you to set an admin password
   5. Auto-generate a secure session encryption key
   6. Create your `.env` file with all required configuration

   <details>
   <summary><strong>Advanced: Manual Configuration</strong></summary>

   Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in the required variables. See `.env.example` for full documentation of each variable.

   </details>

3. **Start the database & app**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run the initial data sync**

   ```bash
   npm run sync
   ```

5. **Open the app**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🔄 Data Synchronization

The app uses a staged ETL pipeline to keep data fresh from two external sources.

| Command              | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run sync`       | Full sync — players, market, stats, lineups |
| `npm run sync:daily` | Daily maintenance sync                      |
| `npm run sync:live`  | Fast polling sync during live games         |

See [`docs/DATA_SYNC.md`](./docs/DATA_SYNC.md) for the full pipeline documentation.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
npm test          # Run all tests (watch mode)
npm test -- --run # Single run
```

66 tests across 7 suites covering API response structure, validation utilities, sync logic, and service integration.
