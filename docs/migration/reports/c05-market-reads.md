# C05 Market read migration

PRELIMINARY INVENTORY ONLY. No Market application edits yet. Final source baseline must be pinned
after C04 acceptance; this receipt is not evidence that the complete Market call graph is reviewed.

## Initial entrypoint inventory

- /market: phone detection precedes reads. Phone concurrently requests current listings, KPIs and
  four recent transfers. Desktop renders MarketPageClient, which owns its browser reads.
- /market/[section]: existing mobile route guard precedes reads. transfers uses fetchAllTransfers;
  trends uses 30-day analysis; bids and investments combine specific arrays from fetchMarketStats.
  Existing descriptions, first-20 generic record rendering and transfer links must be preserved.
- GET /api/market: validates limit (default 50, range 1–500) but does not pass it to getMarketPageData.
  Preserve this currently unused parameter contract; do not silently introduce pagination.
- GET /api/market/stats: fetchMarketStats, force-dynamic, MEDIUM success cache.
- GET /api/market/stats/value-details: transferId numeric validation, force-dynamic, MEDIUM cache.
- GET /api/market/trends: default 30; allows only 7/30/90/180/365 after numeric validation, SHORT cache.
- GET /api/market/transfers: page 1–1000, limit 1–100, trimmed buyer/seller strings, SHORT cache.
- GET /api/market/duels/details: distinct positive user/opponent IDs, force-dynamic, SHORT cache.

These handlers contain no session identity resolver. Complete transitive helper/access and returned
field review is still required before declaring their public success caching safe. successResponse
currently emits public max-age plus stale-while-revalidate; errors use the established error helper.

## Existing owners and dependencies

Two separate global services exist: services/features/marketService provides basic aggregates and
wrappers; services/marketService aggregates roughly thirty analytics queries and enriches manager
identity fields. Neither should be confused with marketActionsService (private/provider operations).
Most statistical implementations reside in db/queries/features/market.ts, mixing SQL, interfaces,
enrichment and ranking calculations. Trace every export and consumer before extraction.

Current listings query uses season-scoped market_listings, latest listed_at, player season facts,
manager seller labels and next-match SQL. It additionally invokes Team playoff probabilities,
Team game counts and Player form helpers before its SQL and scoring projection. Reuse deliberate
Teams/Players contracts, preserving these helper semantics and query order rather than copying queries.
Do not confuse Team playoff probabilities with the separate Playoffs prediction competition.

## Frozen scope and next work

Private offers/accept/reject/remove/sell/sell-all, provider adapters, credentials and sync mutations
remain C11/C12. No production actions, policy changes, schema/dependency work or deployment is authorized.
Next: complete method/export/caller inventory, exact cache and serialization contracts, original
service/HTTP characterization tests, then bounded query/model/service and screen ownership.
